Hello  



This breathing awareness relaxation script will guide you to focus on each stage of a breath as you breathe slowly and gently.



Let's begin. Throughout this breathing awareness exercise, breathe in this way:



Breathe in to the count of four, hold for the count of 3, and breathe out to the count of 5.



Continue to breathe at this slow pace.




While you are breathing slowly, I'll direct your breathing awareness to different stages of the breath. Focus all of your attention on each stage I mention.
